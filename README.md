# Insider_Attack_Detection
We focus on a solution for identifying an insider attack using the artificial intelligence technique. In our project, we track the attackers using a user interaction behavior pattern and deep learning technique. 
The deep belief neural network is designed using a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) so that the layer of RBM communicates with the previous and subsequent layers.
At the end, our project is capable of alerting the system about the insider to user
